    <string name="paint_info"><b>Types of Citadel Paints:</b>\n\nBase:\t\tThe foundation for your painting needs. High pigment content and excellent coverage.
        \n\nShade:\t\tShade paints, also known as a "wash", bring out all the finer details and textures by naturally flowing into the receses.\n\n<b>Layer:</b>\t\t
        Formulated with a certain opacity so they can be applied over Base paints and each other with great results and to create highlights\n\n<b>Edge:</b>\t\t
    Developed to help give your miniatures a final sharp, bright highlight. The paints possess the same formulation as the Citadel Layer Paints,
        but with a much lighter shade to help and you can use them alongside the rest of the Citadel Paint range.\n\n<b>Technical:</b>\t\t
    Designed to help you achieve a range of effects, from creating rust and corrosion to the foetid slurry of Nurgleâ€™s Rot or the bloody gore of Blood for the Blood God.
